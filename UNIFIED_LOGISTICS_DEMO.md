### **Backend Architecture**
```python
# AI-powered data unification
def unify_data(self):
    # Process all data sources
    all_events = []
    
    # Add carrier logs
    for log in self.data_sources['carrier_logs']:
        all_events.append({...})
    
    # Add customs records
    for record in self.data_sources['customs_records']:
        all_events.append({...})
    
    # Add SMS updates
    for sms in self.data_sources['sms_updates']:
        all_events.append({...})
    
    # Group by truck_id and create unified shipments
